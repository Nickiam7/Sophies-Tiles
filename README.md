# Sophie's Tiles

A fast-paced exciting and fun game inspired by Magic Tiles 3, built with React and Phaser.js. Created for my daughter Sophie who loves playing tile games but was frustrated with the overwhelming number of ads in the iPad versions.

## About Sophies Tiles

The iPad/mobile versions of Magic Tiles 3 and other tile games are riddled with ads - sometimes showing ads after every 15 seconds, with unskippable video ads that last 30+ seconds. This ruins the flow and fun of the game, especially for kids. Sophie's Tiles provides the same fun gameplay with:
- **Zero ads** - Play as much as you want, uninterrupted
- **No in-app purchases** - Everything is available from the start
- **Kid-friendly** - Built by a parent, for kids (and adults too!)

## How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. **Green Tiles** - Tap them before they reach the bottom
2. **Blue Tiles** - Tap and HOLD until they're completely filled
3. **Golden Lucky Tiles** - Optional bonus tiles that give random rewards (extra points, extra life, or lose a life)
4. **Don't Miss!** - Missing regular tiles costs you a life. You start with 3 lives.

### Controls
- **Mouse** - Click tiles
- **Touch** - Tap tiles (mobile/tablet)

### Game Features
- **5 Levels** - Each lasting 20 seconds with increasing speed
- **Streak System** - Build combos for bonus points and celebrations at milestones
- **3 Difficulty Modes**:
  - Easy - Normal speed progression
  - Medium - Starts at Level 3 speed
  - Hard - Starts at Level 5 speed (extremely challenging!)
- **Lucky Tiles** - 5% spawn chance with random rewards/penalties
